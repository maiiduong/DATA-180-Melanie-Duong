```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load the dataset in.
```{r}
loan_default <- read.csv("C:/Users/maidn/OneDrive/Desktop/DATA 180 Melanie Duong/DATA-180-Melanie-Duong/DATA-180-Melanie-Duong/loan_default_data_set.csv")
loan_default
```


1. Data Wrangling

a. What is the dimension(shape) of the dataset? How many rows and columns does the dataset have?
```{r}
dim(loan_default)
print("The dataset has 20000 rows and 21 columns.")
```

b. Report the column names of the dataset.
```{r}
colnames(loan_default)
```

c. Which types of data are in the dataset? Numeric, categorical, ordinal?
```{r}
str(loan_default)
```

d. Which columns contain missing values and how much (what percent) of those columns are missing?
```{r}
colnames(loan_default)[colSums(is.na(loan_default)) > 0]

colMissingValue <- colnames(loan_default)[colSums(is.na(loan_default)) > 0]
percent_missing <- (colSums(is.na(loan_default[, colMissingValue])) / nrow(loan_default)) * 100
percent_missing
```

e. How do you think we should deal with missing values?
```{r}
# As far as I observed, there are several ways to fix missing values. First of all, we can remove rows or columns that contain missing values. For this data set, we should remove rows because the amount of missing data is quiet small. If the amount of missing data is substantial, we should delete all the column.
# Another way to deal with missing values is imputation. In this method, we can replace the missing values by the mean or mode values.
# The third method I can think of is to create a new category to represent missing values.
```


f. With this data, would you fit a supervised or unsupervised learning model? Why?
```{r}
# In my opinion, this seems to be an unsupervised learning model because the variables in this data set are independent variables, which means that that do not have have impacts on each other. 
```

g.	For part 2 and 3 drop all rows of the data that contain missing values. Print the dimensions of the resulting data set that has no missing values.
```{r}
no_missing_loan <- na.omit(loan_default)
no_missing_loan
dim(no_missing_loan)
```


2. Data summary statistic

a. Find the summary statistics of the data set. You can use summary function from dplyr. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
summary(no_missing_loan)
```
b.	Based on the mean, mode, and median, is “num_card_inq_24_month” bell shaped, left, right skewed? How about “tot_amount_currently_past_due”? “credit_age”? 
```{r}
# Because median is smaller than mean (0<1.044) so "num_card_ing_24_month" is right skewed.
# "tot_amount_currently_past_due" is also right skewed because median is smaller than mean (0<354.2).
# "credit_age" is bell-shaped because median approximately equals to mean (281 and 208.9).
```

c. Plot a histogram of the variables in b above. Do the shapes of histograms confirm the skewness you found in b?
```{r}
hist(loan_default$num_card_inq_24_month, main = "Histogram of Number of Credit Card Inquiries in last 24 Months", xlab = "Number of Credit Card", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightpink")
hist(loan_default$tot_amount_currently_past_due, main = "Histogram of Total Amount Past due currently for all Credit Accounts", xlab = "Total amount past due", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightpink")
hist(loan_default$credit_age, main = "Histogram of Age in Months of First Credit Product Obtained by the Applicant", xlab = "Age in months of first credit product", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightpink")

# The shapes of histograms match the skewness of each variable I found in part b.
```

d.	How would your convert the “rep_education” column into numerical data? Name two ways. 
```{r}
# As I have learned, two ways to convert text to numerical data are: Counting vectorization and Term frequency-Inverse document frequency.
```


3. Data Visualization:

a. Plot a bar graph for the “Def_Ind” column and describe it. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(loan_default, aes(x = Def_ind)) + geom_bar(fill = 'lightpink', color = "black") + labs(title = "Bar Graph of Indicator of Default", x = 'Indicator of Default', y = 'Frequeny' )

# This bar graph displays the indicator of default. The x-axis of the graph contains two values which are 0 and 1. 1 is account defaulted after an account was approved and opened with the bank in the past 18 months while 0 means not defaulted. The y-axis shows the frequency of each value. There are around 2480 accounts that are defaulted but almost 18000 accounts are not defaulted. The distribution reveals the prevalence of default within the data set, providing a clear understanding of the number of accounts facing financial difficulties. Overall, the proportion of accounts defaulted are approximately 9 times less than the proportion of accounts that are not defaulted. Doing further analysis can find out factors leading to this situation as well as potential risks.
```

b.	Plot a bar graph for the “rep_education" column and describe it.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(loan_default, aes(x = rep_education)) + geom_bar(fill = "lightpink", color = "black") + labs(title = "Bar Graph of Education Level", x = "Education level", y = "Count")

# This graph depicts the education levels of applicants in the data set. The x-axis categorizes education into four levels which are: graduate degree, college degree, high-school or below and others. The y-axis gives us the number of times each of these levels appears. According to the bar graph, the majority of applicants reported that they are in college (about 12450 applicants). In second place is high-school or below with 5500 applicants and then is 2500 graduate applicants and 200 applicants in other education level. This distribution not only provides insights into the education landscape of the applicant pool but also highlights the prevalence of college-level education among them.

```

c. Plot a histogram of the “rep_income” variable.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(loan_default, aes(x = rep_income)) + geom_histogram(fill = "lightpink", color = "black") + labs(title = "Histogram of Annual Income", x = "Income", y = "Frequency")

```

d. Plot a boxplot of the “tot_balance” variable. Using the box plot report the five number summary of the variable? Are there any outliers for this variable? 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
ggplot(loan_default, aes(x = tot_balance)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "lightpink") + labs(title = "Box plot of Total Balance", x = 'Total balance', y = 'Frequency')

summary(loan_default$tot_balance)
Q1 <- quantile(loan_default$tot_balance, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(loan_default$tot_balance, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3-Q1
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5*IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5*IQR

outliers <- loan_default%>% select(tot_balance)%>% filter(tot_balance<lower_bound | tot_balance>upper_bound)
outliers
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
